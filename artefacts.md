The hypothesis that underlies the making of this tool is, “...emerging paths of scholarship that supplement but may also fundamentally alter the research methodologies and outputs of the humanities” (Armoza 1). By inference, the contrast between emerging and traditional techniques is highlighted in the paper’s title: close reading and topic modeling. This leads to the papers primary question: is the method of close reading compatible with quantitative analysis of large data sets?

Armoza starts by observing that quantitative topic analysis outputs lists of words that have to be examined apart from their corpora, i.e. apart from their source texts, which alienates the analyst from close reading techniques. TWiC (Text Words in Context) is the name of Armoza’s analytical tool to enable scholars to understand the cultural object under analysis at different scales: from the corpus level to the individual text level. TWiC can be viewed at the following web address: README.md file at github.com/jarmoza/twic.

The writer posits a world wide shift from textuality to visuality as a motive to develop replicable and a scalable pedagogical methodology to assist instructors in teaching data visualization.
The paper’s central concern is about developing a method to help instructors integrate the following (Jacobs 1):

digital methods 
available resources
pedagogical goals
course content 
concepts of visualization  

Furthermore the method frame-worked is iterative, allowing for a flexibility of redesign to meet the vagaries of available data and computational resources. 

Here is the method step by step:
The research question is formulated
If there is not sufficient source material (i.e. data) available
The question is reformulated around available resources
The available resources are categorized: spatial, temporal, statistical, or categoric
Of these data types, which ones yield evidence to answer the research question
If none of them do, then revisit the research question

Once the data type is determined, the instructor can decide which type of visualization tool to pursue: will it be used to explore information and analysis, or will it be used to present an interpretative visual narrative, will it be static or dynamic. The final decision to be made is, which visualization will provide the best mode of representation: scientific, 
informational, conceptual, spatial, or temporal (Jacobs 2).
